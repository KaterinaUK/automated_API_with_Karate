# Karate Framework :no_good_man: :punch:
Karate is a powerful framework for API testing that allows you to write tests in a simple and elegant way. It is built on top of Cucumber and is designed to make it easy to write tests that are both readable and maintainable.

## Getting Started :mega:
To get started with Karate, you'll need to have Java and Maven installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone this project and adding the Karate dependency to your pom.xml file.

Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.karate</groupId>
    <artifactId>karate-junit4</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.6</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Once you have the dependency set up, you can start writing tests. Karate tests are written in the Gherkin language, which is the same language that Cucumber uses. You can write tests in a *.feature file and run them using JUnit.

## Run your tests :runner:
You can run your tests by using JUnit and providing the path of the feature file or in Visual Studio Code just install a 'karate runner'

## Advanced Features :japanese_castle:
Karate provides a lot of advanced features that make it easy to write more complex tests. Here are a few examples:

### Data-driven testing: Karate allows you to easily create data-driven tests by using the Examples keyword.

### Dynamic variables: You can use dynamic variables in your tests by using the # notation.

### Assertions: Karate provides a powerful assertion library that makes it easy to check that the response from the API matches what you expect.

### Built-in support for JSON and XML: Karate makes it easy to work with JSON and XML by providing built-in support for parsing and manipulating these formats.

## Conclusion
Karate is a powerful framework that makes it easy to write API tests. It is simple to use, but also provides advanced features for more complex testing scenarios. 
If you're looking for a way to write API tests in a simple and elegant way, Karate is definitely worth checking out. :arrows_counterclockwise:
